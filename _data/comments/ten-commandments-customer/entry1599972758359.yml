message: "This is really sound advice.  The funny thing is that my big breaks and best jobs were because I failed many of these commandments.  When I first was brought into Adobe as a consultant to help them get their first internet site built, after digging into their code for a few weeks, that my predecessor built for them, it was clear that the ColdFusion code was completely wrong for the level of scale that they needed.   When the CTO at Adobe (Bill Gates' former assistant at Microsoft) asked me for my honest opinion, I told her exactly what she didn't want to hear.  The code sucked and it needed to be redesigned with better tech, which would take me about 8-10 weeks.   It turned out that she was a total no-bullcrap person, and she loved my honesty.   This was my startup's first long term contract and their CTO also gave us a great lead with Fine.com (run by one of Gates' best friends), where we helped them build the first web sites for Marriott, Burger King and Albertson's.  \r\n\r\nThe one that really helped get my family out of a deep hole was another complete failure of most of these principles, but describes who I am and my values clearly.   I was the 10th and last consultant brought onto a project for a division in a Fortune 500 company with 300 employees that was in jeopardy of being shuttered.  Their software used to dominate their industry for decades, but they had failed for years to convert to the web, despite spending nearly $30m on the effort and their  competitors had taken most of their market share. \r\n\r\nThe day I started the project, my boss with my consulting company told me to start looking for another job because we were about to be fired.  My consulting company had been working on the project for a year, I much later on found it was because their architect tried to build his own web platform using C and it was a complete disaster.  Instead of fessing up, the consulting company lied to the client's execs and said it failed because they had no requirements and we needed a complete reboot.  So the client brought on a team of 4 product managers and two of the best UI designers on the planet, who wrote incredible requirements.  When I started, though, they were 6 weeks into the dev cycle after the reboot and we were producing 1 point a week, with 9 developers!   My second week with the company we were in Chicago meeting the client with my entire group and I mistakenly sat down next to the Exec Program Manager (who was sitting 10 seats from anyone else).  She introduced herself by saying \"who the **** are you? \"  She then railed on how bad my company was and how we were going to be fired and sued.  I calmly asked her about the history of the project and her division and got a mouthful.  It hurt me to hear that 300 people were about to lose their jobs.   My company was still telling them that requirements were the problem, but in my first week there I saw that the requirements were perfect - the best I've ever seen.    My company was still lying to her about every aspect of the project, including that we'd make the 5 month deadline.   As she and I talked through the first few days in Chicago, and knowing I had NOTHING to lose being so new and about to be canned, I took the client's side.  I told her the truth about the requirements. I told her honestly I thought we were 14 months away with the current team but I also gave her my guarantee that we had the ability to give them exactly what they needed.  She and I became good friends, talking many times a day.   When we did release the software exactly 14 months later, my company was terminated, but the client turned around and hired me as an independent consultant and gave me a $15/hr raise (the client told my company they wouldn't sue them if they let me stay with them).  I ended up working for them as a consultant for an unheard of 5 years, got one of my best friends hired there, and got to work with and learn from the some of the most brilliant, talented people on the planet.  The software we built grew at 300% annually the first 5 years, dominates the industry in market share now, and is responsible for over $100m/yr in revenue.    By breaking all the rules, I helped my consulting company to keep a $10m/year project, get their first very large success story, the client built the best web based product in the world, and many of my close colleagues for the client have been promoted 2 or 3 levels due to the success of the product.   \r\n\r\nSo, my #1 commandment is NEVER lie to the client.  All other commandments can be broken to make sure you adhere to this."
